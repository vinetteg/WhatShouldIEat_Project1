# What Should I Eat?- Team Project

## Summary

What Should I Eat? is a random recipe generator. A user will select one of the four main ingredient buttons and a random recipe, including the chosen main ingredient will appear. What Should I Eat? was created with the idea that a user has a main ingredient in mind, but is in search of a few recipe options.

The following is the original user story for What Should I Eat?

> AS A busy person <br>
> I WANT TO be able to get a recipe by selecting a main ingredient <br>
> SO THAT I can review photos & recipes that match what I have available at home <br>
